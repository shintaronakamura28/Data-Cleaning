    "Your task is to clean and explore a dataset for automobile insurance company investors that describes trends in insurance complaint ranking data. They are particularly interested in learning about various automobile insurance companies and their trends in complaints.\n",

    "> \"The DFS ranks automobile insurance companies doing business in New York State based on the number of consumer complaints upheld against them as a percentage of their total business over a two-year period. Complaints typically involve issues like delays in the payment of no-fault claims and nonrenewal of policies. Insurers with the fewest upheld complaints per million dollars of premiums appear at the top of the list. Those with the highest complaint ratios are ranked at the bottom.\" - ny.gov\n",
